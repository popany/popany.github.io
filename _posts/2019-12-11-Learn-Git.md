## [2.5 Git Basics - Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)

## [command]

[`git-clone`](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) - Clone a repository into a new directory

`-b <name>`  
`--branch <name>`  
Instead of pointing the newly created `HEAD` to the branch pointed to by the cloned repository’s `HEAD`, point to `<name>` branch instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that will be checked out. `--branch` can also take tags and detaches the `HEAD` at that commit in the resulting repository.

`--[no-]single-branch`

Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch, either specified by the `--branch` option or the primary branch remote’s `HEAD` points at. Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the initial cloning. If the `HEAD` at the remote did not point at any branch when `--single-branch` clone was made, no remote-tracking branch is created.
